=head1 NAME

Slang::NumberBase - provide number base literals

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=begin code :lang<raku>

use Slang::NumberBase;

say ₈123.45;   # 173.346315
say ₃₆123.45;  # 3F.G77777

=end code

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Slang::NumberBase> distribution provides a slang that will
interprete literal numeric values that start with subscripted digits
("₀₁₂₃₄₅₆₇₈₉") as the number base in which the numeric value should
be expressed.

So in effect "₈123.45" is short for "123.45.base(8)".

Note that only number bases 2..36 are currently supported, as these
are the values that are supported by the
L<C<base>|https://docs.raku.org/routine/base> method.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Tom Browder for the idea.
